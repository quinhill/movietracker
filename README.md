### Installing

To run MovieTracker on your machine, you will need to clone down this repository as well as the backend repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker

Follow the instructions in the backend repository's ReadMe on how to start up the backend, including setting up PostGres.

Once the backend is running, come back to this repository and clone it down with the following command:

`git clone git@github.com:quinhill/movietracker.git`

Then `cd` into the cloned repository and run:

`npm install`

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can then run this command, which should open the app in your browser.

`npm start`

### APIs

For this project, we made a fetch call to receive the data of currently playing movies from an API hosted by www.themoviedb.org.
