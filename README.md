# MovieTracker

MovieTracker is an app that allows users to see what is currently playing and add movies they would like to see to their favorites. 

For this project, we made a fetch call to receive the data from an API hosted by www.themoviedb.org. 

Although the app is on too low a scale to require it, we used this project to familiarize ourselves with React-Redux, also implementing React-Router for the first time.

MovieTracker works with a locally hosted backend, to allow for users to create an account and store favorites. This data is then retrievable on sign in.

### Requirements to Run MovieTracker

- To run MovieTracker on your machine, you will need to clone down this repository as well as the backend repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker
- Follow the instructions in the backend repository's ReadMe on how to start up the backend, including setting up Postgress.
- Once the backend is running, `cd` back into this repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

Enjoy!
